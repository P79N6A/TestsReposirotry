/** 
 * The RandomCheck Job does a lot of our work.  It takes in a num/string keyspace, and transforms it into a key/count(int) keyspace. The map() function just emits a num/1 pair for every num/string input pair. The reduce() function sums up all the 1s that were emitted for a single key.  It then emits the key/total pair. This is used to regenerate the random number "answer key". Each key here is a random number, and the count is the number of times the number was emitted.
