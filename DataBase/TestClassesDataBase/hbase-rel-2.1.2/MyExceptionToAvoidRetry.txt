/** 
 * A trick is used to make sure server-side failures( if any ) not being covered up by a client retry. Since LoadIncrementalHFiles.doBulkLoad keeps performing bulkload calls as long as the HFile queue is not empty, while server-side exceptions in the doAs block do not lead to a client exception, a bulkload will always succeed in this case by default, thus client will never be aware that failures have ever happened . To avoid this kind of retry , a MyExceptionToAvoidRetry exception is thrown after bulkLoadPhase finished and caught silently outside the doBulkLoad call, so that the bulkLoadPhase would be called exactly once, and server-side failures, if any ,can be checked via data.
