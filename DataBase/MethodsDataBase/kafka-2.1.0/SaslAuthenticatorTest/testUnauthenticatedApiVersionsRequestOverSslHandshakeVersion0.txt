 * Tests that Kafka ApiVersionsRequests are handled by the SASL server authenticator prior to SASL handshake flow and that subsequent authentication succeeds when transport layer is SSL. This test simulates SASL authentication using a (non-SASL) SSL client and sends ApiVersionsRequest straight after SSL handshake, before any SASL-related packets are sent. This test is run with SaslHandshake version 0 and no SaslAuthenticate headers.
