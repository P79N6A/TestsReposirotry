/** 
 * This test should never pass, simply because Spring does not support a hybrid approach for annotation attribute overrides with transitive implicit aliases. See SPR-13554 for details. <p>Furthermore, if you choose to execute this test, it can fail for either the first test class or the second one (with different exceptions), depending on the order in which the JVM returns the attribute methods via reflection.
