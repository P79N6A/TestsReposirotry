/** 
 * This test validates the correctness of GetClusterMetrics in case the cluster is composed of only 1 bad SubCluster and a good one. The good SubCluster provided a ClusterMetricsInfo with appsSubmitted set to its SubClusterId. The expected result would be appSubmitted equals to its SubClusterId. SubClusterId in this case is an integer.
